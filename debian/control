Description: user-space access to Linux Kernel SCTP - shared library
 This library is part of the LKSCTP project for the
 Linux Kernel SCTP reference implementation.
 .
 This package is intended to supplement the Linux Kernel
 SCTP reference implementation now available in the Linux
 kernel source tree in versions 2.5.36 respectively 2.4.24 and following.
 .
 SCTP (Stream Control Transmission Protocol) is a message oriented,
 reliable transport protocol, with congestion control, support for
 transparent multi-homing, and multiple ordered streams of messages.
 RFC2960 defines the core protocol.

 .
 This package is part of the LKSCTP project.
 .
 It includes the following commandline tools:
  * checksctp: Determine if kernel supports SCTP
  * withsctp: Run existing TCP binaries over SCTP
  * sctp_darn: Send and receive messages via SCTP
  * sctp_test: Userspace test application for the SCTP kernel
    reference implementation
