                      HOW TO COMPILE, RUN AND INSTALL
                      -------------------------------

The lksctp-tools package is intended for two audiences.  
	1) SCTP application developers
	2) LKSCTP project developers

For SCTP application developers, this package provides the user-level
C language header files and a library for accessing SCTP specific
application programming interfaces not provided by the standard sockets. 

For LKSCTP project developers, this package provides the functional
and API regression tests.

For either role, this project provides sample code, utilities, and
tests that one may find useful.  

The below INSTALL directions are provided with in each of these roles.

NOTE:  To build, run and install the lksctp-tools package, your system is 
required to be running with linux-2.5.36, or a later version of the 
kernel, configured with the Network options "SCTP Configuration" 
support enabled.

INSTALLATION   
-------------
Prerequisite:  A Linux kernel with SCTP support.  This may come stock with 
your distrbution (some day), or you will need to build your own 2.5.36 or
later kernel.

To install/build the lksctp-tools utilities/tests do the following:

1) Download and install the following binary RPMs from the lksctp sourceforge
   website at 
	http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=26529
   * lksctp-tools-x.y.z-1.i386.rpm
   * lksctp-tools-x.y.z-devel-1.i386.rpm
   * lksctp-tools-x.y.z-doc-1.i386.rpm

   lksctp-tools-x.y.z-1.i386.rpm includes 
   * SCTP run-time library.
   * Sample SCTP applications: sctp_darn and sctp_test.
   * withsctp: a tool when used with existing TCP binaries replaces TCP
               with SCTP.

   lksctp-tools-x.y.z-devel-1.i386.rpm includes
   * SCTP header file /usr/include/netinet/sctp.h
   * SCTP man pages.
   * Source code for sample SCTP applications.

   lksctp-tools-x.y.z-doc-1.i386.rpm includes
   * SCTP RFC's and internet drafts. 

   If you want to run and play with the included sample SCTP applications or 
   develop your own SCTP applications, you can skip the rest of the
   instructions.

   If you are interested in running the functional regression tests included
   in the lksctp-tools package, continue with the following instructions.

2) Download and install the following source RPM form the lksctp sourceforge
   website at 
        http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=26529
   * lksctp-tools-x.y.z-1.src.rpm
   This will install the lksctp-tools gzipped tarball and RPM spec file. 

3) Untar the lksctp-tools directory from the gzipped tarball. This creates a 
   subdirectory called lksctp-tools-x.y.z. 

   Ensure you have autoconf, automake and libtool packages installed on your
   system.

4) Run ./bootstrap

5) Run ./configure

6) Run make

7) To run the SCTP kernel regression tests,
  
   $ cd src/func_tests
   $ make v4test (regression tests for the IPv4 socket support)
   $ make v6test (regression tests for the IPv6 socket support)

8) Run other SCTP test tools/applications in src/apps directory to verify the
   running SCTP.
